# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to combine and practice implementing SQL skills which includes 

1. Loading data into a database
2. Extracting data from a SQL database
3. Cleaning, transforming and analyzing data
4. Developing and implementing a QA process to validate transformed data against raw data

## Process
### Step 1 loading CSV files into database
CSV files were imported into tables created in SQL database
### Step 2 Cleaning and transforming data
The data was cleaned and transformed following several actions which included fixing datatypes, removing irrelevant, redundant and duplicate data
cleaning several structural  issues, cleaning and handling missing values, looking for outliers and normalizing and scaling down values
### Step 3 Analysing the data
Queries were performed on the data to analyse it and obtain insights about the various business indices like total revenue, products ordered or left in stock as well as the popularity of products across different geographical locations and  also check and analyse website data from the given business organisation
### Step 4 Implementing the QA process and spotting any QA errors


## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
understanding and making sense of data
to decide what to do about missing values 

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
should have used views instead of tables
should have given more time in understanding and eliminating missing values
spent more time in making detailed documentation and presentation
